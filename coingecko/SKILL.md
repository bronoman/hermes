## Security Architecture

CoinGecko API key **never** reaches Hermes chat or logs.  
All price data queries are **read-only** (no signing, no write permissions).  
Credentials stored **only** in `~/.hermes/.env` with **restricted file permissions** (0600).

---

## Core Scripts

All scripts are in:  
`~/.hermes/skills/coingecko/scripts/`

- `fetch_price.py` — Fetch live BTC/USD from CoinGecko or Kraken  
- `fetch_multi_asset.py` — Query multiple crypto assets at once  
- `health_check.py` — Verify API connectivity and key validity  

---

## Quick Usage

### Fetch Current BTC/USD Price
```bash
~/.hermes/coingecko-env/bin/python3 ~/.hermes/skills/coingecko/scripts/fetch_price.py
# Returns: {"price": 81291.00, "price_str": "$81,291.00", "change_24h": 0.48, ...}
```

### Fetch Multiple Assets
```bash
~/.hermes/coingecko-env/bin/python3 ~/.hermes/skills/coingecko/scripts/fetch_multi_asset.py bitcoin ethereum
# Returns: {"bitcoin": {"price": 81291}, "ethereum": {"price": 2432.50}}
```

### Health Check (Verify API Key)
```bash
~/.hermes/coingecko-env/bin/python3 ~/.hermes/skills/coingecko/scripts/health_check.py
# Returns: {"api_status": "ok", "key_type": "demo", "rate_limit_remaining": 10}
```

---

## Skill Details

This skill provides **standalone cryptocurrency price data integration** for Hermes. Fetch live Bitcoin and Ethereum prices, query thousands of crypto assets, and integrate market data into any workflow—all with automatic fallback to Kraken API if CoinGecko key is unavailable.

**Key Advantage:** Works as an independent skill. Can be used for trading, research, monitoring, alerts, or any use case that needs live crypto prices. content processors and other downstream systems call this skill as needed.

## API Key Types Explained

### Demo Key (Free ✅)
- **Where to get:** https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation
- **Signup:** 2 minutes, email + password
- **Limits:** 10-50 calls/minute (rate-limited but stable)
- **Endpoint:** `https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/...` with `x_cg_demo_api_key` param
- **Cost:** Free forever
- **Best for:** Low volume trading, Hermes agents, hobby projects, content generation

### Pro Key (Paid 💰)
- **Where to get:** https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/pricing
- **Signup:** 5 minutes via API dashboard
- **Limits:** Unlimited calls (enterprise tier available)
- **Endpoint:** Same as Demo, with `x_cg_pro_api_key` param
- **Cost:** $10-50/month depending on tier
- **Best for:** High-volume data pipelines, trading bots, critical services

**Script handles both automatically** — no code changes needed. Just add key to `.env` and script auto-detects type.

   COINGECKO_API_KEY=CG-JptZUWeFoPzfDLKmFPE3bMn3
   ```
7. **Test:** Run health_check.py to verify

---

## Dual-Source Redundancy

If CoinGecko key fails or is rate-limited, script **automatically falls back to Kraken API** (no auth needed):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ fetch_price.py                          │
│  1. Try CoinGecko (has more data)       │
│     ├─ With Demo key: 10-50 calls/min   │
│     ├─ With Pro key: unlimited          │
│     └─ On rate-limit: timeout ×3, then →├─┐
│  2. Fall back to Kraken (no auth)       │ │
│     ├─ Always works for BTC/USD         │ │
│     ├─ Limited to major pairs           │ │
│     └─ Returns: {"BTC": price, ...}     │ │
│  3. On both fail: Return error          │ │
│                                         │ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘ │
  Return: {"price": N, "source": "..."}   ←─┘
```

## Security & Privacy

### ✅ What You Can Trust

**API Key Isolation**
- COINGECKO_API_KEY never appears in Hermes prompts, memory, or logs
- Only `fetch_price.py` reads from `$COINGECKO_API_KEY` environment
- Script returns only **public data** (price, market cap, 24h change)
- Key is **read-only** — CoinGecko API has no write/delete permissions

**No Data Leakage**
- Price data is public (anyone can fetch without a key)
- API key only needed for rate-limit increases
- Hermes Agent never sees the key during operation

**Transparent & Auditable**
- All API calls logged with timestamp and source
- Error messages never contain credential details
- Fallback behavior is deterministic and logged

### ⚠️ What You Must Do

**Protect .env File**
```bash
chmod 600 ~/.hermes/.env
# File permissions: read/write for user only, no group/other access
```

**Never Share Your Key**
- Don't paste `.env` in chat, tickets, or public repos
- Don't commit `.env` to git (add to `.gitignore`)
- If key is exposed, regenerate in CoinGecko dashboard (takes 2 minutes)

**Rotate Keys Periodically**
- Even for free keys, rotate every 6-12 months
- Check CoinGecko dashboard for suspicious activity
- If suspicious: regenerate immediately

## Troubleshooting

### Symptom: "Connection timeout" or "No such host"

**Cause:** Network unreachable or DNS failure

**Fix:**
```bash
# Test connectivity to CoinGecko
curl -s https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/ping

# Should return: {"gecko_says":"..."}
# If fails: Check internet connection, firewall, DNS
```

### Symptom: "Invalid API key" or 401 Unauthorized

**Cause:** Key is malformed, expired, or incorrect

**Fix:**
1. Verify key in `~/.hermes/.env` (no extra spaces)
2. Check CoinGecko dashboard — key may have expired
3. Regenerate key and update `.env`
4. Test with: `health_check.py`

### Symptom: "Rate limit exceeded" (HTTP 429)

**Cause:** Demo key limit reached (10-50 calls/min)

**Fix:**
1. Wait 1-2 minutes (rate limit resets)
2. Script auto-retries with exponential backoff
3. Upgrade to Pro key for unlimited access
4. Or: Reduce query frequency

### Symptom: Kraken fallback returns "No data"

**Cause:** Kraken doesn't support that trading pair

**Fix:**
- Kraken only supports major pairs (BTC/USD, ETH/USD)
- For altcoins, CoinGecko Demo key is required
- Upgrade to Pro key to avoid rate limits on altcoins

## Author Notes

This skill represents clean, secure, **standalone** cryptocurrency data integration for Hermes Agent. Every operation is:
- **Read-only** (no write permissions to markets or accounts)
- **Redundant** (dual-source fallback to Kraken)
- **Transparent** (all API calls logged with timestamp)
- **Credential-safe** (keys never exposed in prompts or memory)
- **Self-contained** (no dependencies on downstream systems)

The philosophy is simple: **Live market data should be free and accessible**. This skill brings that to Hermes through both free (Demo API) and professional (Pro API) tiers, with automatic fallback so you always get a price.

Downstream systems like the Daily Intelligence Brief call this skill when they need live price data. The skill has no knowledge of or dependency on calling processes, it is purely a data provider.

**Philosophy:** Bitcoin is the hardest money ever created. Hermes should know its price in real-time, always. This skill makes that possible, for any use case.

PRs welcome.
